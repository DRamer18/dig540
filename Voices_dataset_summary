Voices of Mobile Dataset
DIG 540 Donna Ramer
 
For my modeling dataset, I decided to group individuals and groups who have made impressions on my hometown through their unique voices. I called the Database “Voices of Mobile,” for this reason. If I had both the time and experience, I would love to flesh this database out with links to both recordings and videos. Considerations for future iterations of the database were the basis for the fields in my primary recording table. As a librarian I felt genres represented would be an excellent way of organizing a much larger group of voices, so I chose to link it since I discovered early that one recording could have multiple genres. (This was especially evident looking at LC collections, For example something could be both a field recording and a chant or song or sermon.)  I chose to also document both year and permission in my recordings table to make sure I could easily collate copyright/public domain considerations for future iterations.
Most of my thorny issues at this point are directly related to lack of knowledge and experience in manipulating the code. (Although repetition in coding is a “methodical madness” learning exercise. It helps the environment become more intuitive.)  In my original schema I had both contributor and genre in separate tables linked back to recording. I did this because I wanted to use the contributor data to display the images required for the project. Displaying the images is still an issue I’m working to correct as of this writing. My reasoning here was the idea of connecting “faces” to the voices creating another layer of manipulation and another experience within the dataset.  As I started the final project I got stuck at several points trying to make a more complicated schema than examples we walked through, so I decided about a week ago to pare-down my expectations for myself and integrate contributor into the main recording table. I would imagine that deadlines for projects require this to happen often in the real coding world, until a later iteration can address the issue.
However, I still wanted to remain true to the idea of faces with the voices, so I currently have the html tag written into the contributor table, mainly because of time issues and flu/Christmas. Although it isn’t currently working, I’m including my intent below and will continue to work with the project until it *is* working! I just ran out of time with many factors beyond my control eating away at time. It’s also hard to code with the flu (or something similar) especially when some of it seems like a foreign language. I think planning and implementation in the real world would likely need some padding of time if a project needed to be completed and run through several iterations for a client.  
Relationships abound! One title or recording may have several contributors, it sortof depends on how granular the database writer wants to go. The same with subjects (sort of an occupational hazard being a librarian), but I chose an economy of scale here given this learning environment. Below are my links to photographs, and the html tags are in my “final final” csv. I ended up re-writing the csv however, placing the contributor as the last column. Weirdly when I had it before genre, the databased picked up the contributor html tag as part of genre. When I moved contributor to the last column it solved this problem. I’m a bit of a perfectionist so its difficult for me to turn anything in that isn’t exactly how it should be, but I know professors have grading deadlines and you’ve been very gracious. Any suggestions for continuing forward with the images are greatly appreciated as I’ll work to perfect this project through Christmas.
Below are my hyperlinks and html tags for images:
